üê∂ End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification
This notebook builds and end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub

Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog

Data

Evaluation
the evalution is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test shape

Features
we're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's proabbly best we use deep learning/transfer learning.
there are 120 breeds of dogs(120 different classes)
There are 10000+ images in training set (these images have labels)
There are 10000+ images in test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them).
